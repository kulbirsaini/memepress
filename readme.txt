== Credits ==

[Kulbir Saini](http://gofedora.com/) - This plugin is completely inspired from Twitter for WordPress. Basically the code was just copied and modified to support Yahoo! Meme and then a few more features were added. A lot of credits goes to [Ricardo Gonz‡lez](http://rick.jinlabs.com/code/twitter).

[Ronald Heft](http://cavemonkey50.com/) - The plugin is highly based in his Pownce for Wordpress, so the major part of the credits goes to him.

[Michael Feichtinger](http://bohuco.net/blog) - For the multi-widget feature.

[Yalcin Erdemir](http://y4lcin.com/) - For Turkish Translation.
